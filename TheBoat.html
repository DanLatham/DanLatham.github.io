<h1>My Boat</h1>


<P1> I Bought his boat last year as an upgrade from my previous boat. This boat is 32ft and has a 6 cylinder diesel engine in it. It's a 1979 and back when it was first made it was a emergency search boat. </P1>


<p1>My grand father used to work for maine central power company he would go to all the islands in casco bay to service there electricity and his boat was the same style as the one I have now. I named my boat Hallelujah 2 because my grandfathers  was the original hallelujah. </p1>
